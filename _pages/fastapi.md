### 📌 Description

**PhotoShare** is a scalable, asynchronous photo-sharing application built with **FastAPI**. Designed as a lightweight, Instagram-style platform, it enables users to upload photos, interact through likes and comments, and manage personal profiles — all while leveraging a **modern Python backend stack** with secure, token-based authentication.

The architecture emphasizes **performance**, **security**, and **modularity**, making it suitable for both production-grade deployments and as a boilerplate for social media-style applications.

### 🧩 Problems It Solves

- ✅ Offers a modular and extensible backend foundation for photo-sharing platforms  
- ✅ Handles image uploads, metadata, and user interactions at scale  
- ✅ Provides JWT-secured login and registration flows  
- ✅ Supports content moderation and role-based access via user roles  
- ✅ Simplifies frontend consumption with RESTful, documented endpoints  
- ✅ Integrates easily into CI/CD pipelines with containerized deployments
